            <div style="background-color:#f2a4eb;color:white;padding:20px;">
          <p style="font-size:30px;">Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s.

           <div style="background-color:#f2a4eb;color:white;padding:20px;">
           <p style="font-size:30px;">In the midterm of 2012,Me and my Family went to Disneyland.We stayed in the resort for 8 Days and 8 nights
           We stayed in a hotel with a Wild West Theme.It was one of the lesser end hotels in comparison to the 5 star hotels on show
           The Crowds in the park were massive and the lines to the attractions were even longer
           Despite the long hours of waiting in queues the attractions were worth it as they were out of this world in terms of quality
           I really enjoyed my stay in Disneyland and would highly recommend it to others</p>
